          a theme: The Next Big Thing
          and a film genre randomly selected from a list: Drama, Romance, Buddy Film, Dark Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, and Comedy.

          There is no feeling quite like seeing something that you made displayed for the enjoyment of others, and no venue quite as breathtaking as the silver screen. Most students never have the opportunity to sit in a dark theater, surrounded by their classmates and peers, and see a film that they poured their hearts and souls into receive its worldwide theatrical premiere. The goal and mission of
          %strong The Broke Student Film Festival
          is to inspire and encourage student filmmakers by giving them a safe, constructive, and glamorous forum to exhibit the fruits of all their hard work, passion and creativity.
