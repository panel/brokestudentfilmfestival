## The 14-Day Challenge

The Inaugural IBSFF 14-Day Challenge was an immense success thanks to all of the stupendously talented student filmmakers who took on the challenge of creating a short film in only two weeks.  In 2015, the 14-Day Challenge will not be curated as part of the Festival in April, but will return as a standalone competition later in the year.  Stay tuned!
