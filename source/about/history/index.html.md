## **Past Festivals**

****
_**1st Annual Broke Student Film Festival | 2012 **_

The first beginnings of the Broke Student Film Festival came from our founder, Kathryn Ruff. At the time Lawrence Technological University did not feature a film festival, so she set out to create one. With the help of the Dean of Students, Kevin Finn and Jody Gaber ,Director of Media Communication, Kathryn pulled the first film festival together in little over a month. Featureing only 12 films, 4 of them her own, the first BSFF started. The biggest winner was the filmmakers, now they have a wonderful and safe environment for their work to be screened.

Audiences enjoyed live music from local Detroit bands, The Wall Clocks and The Anthony Lai band. But the grandest feature of the 2013 festival, was the live performance of Death of a Snow Bird accompanyied by a live orchestra compsed by Anthony Lai. Leaving the audience in tears, the festival closed on another successful year.

***3rd Annual International Broke Student Film Festival | 2014 ***




From April 4th through April 6th, Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, MI will be playing host to the 3rd Annual International Broke Student Film Festival.  Started by alumnus Kathryn Ruff in 2012, the Festival reaches out to student filmmakers from Southeast Michigan and around the world.  The Broke Student Film Festival is one of the only venues in Michigan that gives aspiring student filmmakers the opportunity to see their work screened in a theater in front of a live audience and receive feedback from professionals with decades of experience in the film and video industry.
In addition to the screenings, the Broke Student Film Festival is also hosting a series of educational workshops that are free to attend for students and are geared toward teaching students how to survive and thrive in the film and video industry.  These workshops will be taught by industry professionals and will take place in the morning and early afternoon of Saturday, April 5th before the competitive screenings.  Also during this time, the Festival will host a meet and greet that will invite students to meet and talk to industry partners from around the Southeast Michigan area.  This networking opportunity will be invaluable to students and businesses alike, connecting talent with opportunity.
