## **Past Festivals**

****
_**1st Annual Broke Student Film Festival | 2012 **_

The first beginnings of the Broke Student Film Festival came from our founder, Kathryn Ruff. At the time Lawrence Technological University did not feature a film festival, so she set out to create one. With the help of the Dean of Students, Kevin Finn and Jody Gaber ,Director of Media Communication, Kathryn pulled the first film festival together in little over a month. Featuring only 12 films, 4 of them her own, the first BSFF started. The biggest winner was the filmmakers, now they have a wonderful and safe environment for their work to be screened.

***2nd Annual International Broke Student Film Festival | 2013 ***



For the first time, the festival became International with the submission "Kachho Gadulo (Little Gypsy)"  by Saptesh Chaubal. This was the humble beginnings of the International Broke Student Film Festival. The 2013 Broke Student Film Festival brought together 24 films from 4 nations (the USA, United Kingdom, India and Australia) for one amazing evening.  Saptesh Chaubal, a student from India, won Best Film and Audience Choice for his submission, Little Gypsy.  Jeremy Liesen, a student at Washtenaw Community College in Ann Arbor, won Best Domestic Film and Best Editing for his film, Listen.  Samantha Bushey of Wayne State University and Michael Hovitch of Washtenaw Community College shared the award for Best Screenwriting for their films, Neon Prairie and Game Board Nerd, respectively.  Samanthaâ€™s film, Neon Prairie, also won Best Acting.  Scott Campbell of Washtenaw Community College won Best Music for his music video, A Song to Fall In Love To.  And finally, James Montour from College for Creative Studies in Detroit won Best Cinematography for his film, Day of Light. 

Audiences enjoyed live music from local Detroit bands, The Wall Clocks and The Anthony Lai band. But the grandest feature of the 2013 festival, was the live performance of Death of a Snow Bird accompanied by a live orchestra conducted by Anthony Lai. Leaving the audience in tears, the festival closed on another successful year.
