Upon entry, all films are screened and approved by the International Broke Student Film Festival Selection Committee. Films are then screened by industry professionals in the  International Broke Student Film Festival Judges screening at Lawrence Technical University in Southfield, Michigan. Films will be judged based on the following criteria: Cinematography, Screenwriting, Sound, Acting, and Originality. The ballots are then counted as a general score per judge and then the overall score is met. Some films may score the same overall score. In this instance, both films win the award. (IBSFF 2013 had two Best Screenwriting awards) All decisions are final.__
