## About the IBSFF

The Broke Student Film Festival was founded in 2012 as a place where aspiring filmmakers and storytellers can display their work and receive constructive feedback from industry professionals.

There is no feeling quite like seeing something that you made displayed for the enjoyment of others, and no venue quite as breathtaking and as the silver screen. Most students never have the opportunity to sit in a dark theater, surrounded by their classmates and peers, and see a film that they poured their hearts and souls into receive itâ€™s worldwide theatrical premiere. The goal and mission of the Broke Student Film Festival is to inspire and encourage student filmmakers by giving them a safe, constructive, and glamorous forum to exhibit the fruits of all their hard work, passion and creativity.
